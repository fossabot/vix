            Will allocate the first free block found that is big enough.
            Fast but may waste memory.
	config KMALLOC_BEST_SIZE
		bool "best size"
        help
            Will search for the block that is the closest to the wanted size. 
            Allocation is slower but saves more memory.

config KFREE_CLEANUP
    bool "Enable kfree cleanup"
    help
        A cleanup frees physical memory and makes it available to the whole system again.
        Cleanups cause fragmentation which will make overall allocations slower.

    help
        kfree will clean up every KFREE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL times it gets called.
        A cleanup frees physical memory.
        Bigger value -> less efficient memory usage but kfree runs faster.
